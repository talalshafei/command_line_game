# command_line_game
Simple 3D shooter game on the Command Prompt in Windows using only ASCII characters.

## Important
The program has specified requirements for the console size, which should be set to 120 columns by 40 rows. It is suggested to use a small font type of "Consolas" with a font size of 16. This can be done by launching the program, clicking on the title bar of the console, and adjusting the settings.

## Controls
A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards

## Future Modifications
1) Shade block segments based on angle from player, i.e. less light reflected off
	walls at side of player. Walls straight on are brightest.
2) Find an interesting and optimised ray-tracing method. I'm sure one must exist
	to more optimally search the map space
3) Add bullets!
4) Add bad guys!
